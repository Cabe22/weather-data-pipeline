# Weather Data Pipeline

A comprehensive data engineering and machine learning project that demonstrates end-to-end data pipeline development with real-time weather data collection, processing, and predictive analytics.

## Project Overview

This project showcases skills in:
- **Data Engineering**: ETL pipeline with API data collection
- **Data Processing**: Feature engineering and data transformation  
- **Machine Learning**: Predictive models for weather forecasting
- **Data Visualization**: Interactive dashboards with Streamlit
- **DevOps**: Docker containerization and deployment

## Architecture
```
Weather API → Data Collection → Processing → ML Models → Dashboard
     ↓              ↓              ↓           ↓          ↓
OpenWeatherMap → SQLite DB → Feature Eng → XGBoost → Streamlit
```

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up your API key in `.env` file
4. Run data collection: `python src/data_collection/weather_collector.py`
5. Launch dashboard: `streamlit run dashboard.py`

## Features
